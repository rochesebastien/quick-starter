# Introduction

This is a quick starter that i use when i need to experiments stuff or to create a small app with only HTML/CSS/JS. I created this starter to prevent me from recreating the architecture of my files each time and to make it easier for me to compile the SCSS.


# Installation

To use this starter you just need to clone this repository with the command below :

```cmd
  git clone https://github.com/rochesebastien/quick-start-project
```

I then use the **Live Sass Compiler** application available on Visual Studio Code. It allows to compile the **SCSS** file in **CSS** without using NodeJS.
